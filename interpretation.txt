When comparing the 1953 dataset to the 2008 dataset I observed that the countries in cluster 1 decreased
from 1953 to 2006. The countries in cluster 2 and cluster 3 increased. In the 1953 dataset the life
expectancy of the first cluster is the lowest. Cluster 2 and cluster 3 have a higher life expectancy
where cluster 3's life expectancy is the highest. When comparing the 1953 dataset with the 2008 dataset
it's clear that the life expectancy in of the cluster 1 and 2 decreased while cluster 3's life expectancy
increased. With these observations it is safe to say that the there were countries who moved from cluster 1
to cluster 2 and 3 and there could even have been countries that moved from cluster 2 to cluster 3.
In the datsets there is a clear indecation that the birth rate decreased in all the clusters, so we can assume
that the birth rate in most or in all the countries have decreased.

When looking at the data from the dataBoth dataset. the data from 2008 and 1953 can be compared by looking
at the amount of countries that are in each cluster. it is safe to say that there are only 1953 countries 
in cluster 1. In cluster 2 the 2008 countries are much more than the 1953 countries. In cluster 3 the 1953
countries are much more than the 1953 countries. In cluster 4 the 2008 countries are much more than the 
2008 countries. There are clusters that are made up mostly out of 1953 countries and that is cluster 1 and 
cluster 3. The reason for that the 1953 countries are in these clusters could have to do with the life expectancy.
 Although these clusters have a higher birth rate they have a lower life expectancy which could be the reason why these
two clusters contain more of the 1953 countries. There are clustersmade up mostly out of 2008 countries and that clusters
 are cluster 2 and cluster 4. The reason the 2008 countries is more in these to clusters is because in both of these to 
cluster the life expectancy is higher than the birth rate which could be a indication that in the 2008 countries there 
where much less birth's than in the other clusters.
